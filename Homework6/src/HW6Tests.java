/*You will need to test your code by writing JUnit tests. (You will submit this to Web-CAT too.)
You will need to write at least two (2) JUnit tests (using JUnit 4) for each of the following methods:
- the Willow constructor
- compareTo() in Willow (which also tests the sortByNaturalOrdering() method)
- compare(Willow p1, Willow p2) in CmpByBedroomsAndGarage (which also tests the sortByBedroomsAndGarage() method)
- compare(Willow p1, Willow p2) in CmpByNeighborhoodAndPrice (which also tests the sortByNeighborhoodAndPrice() method)
You are encouraged to perform main-method testing as well to quickly test your code.
